/**
 * Pre-"boxed width" shape: the accordion wrapper had no `is-boxed` class or
 * inline max-width, since the `boxed`/`boxedWidth` attributes didn't exist
 * yet. Without this, every FAQ block saved before that change would show as
 * invalid content the next time its post is opened in the editor.
 *
 * A deprecation entry does NOT automatically inherit the attributes block
 * supports injects at registration time (textColor, backgroundColor,
 * gradient, fontSize, anchor) — those only get added to the block's own
 * top-level `attributes` when the real block registers, never to a
 * deprecation's schema, whether declared explicitly or left off entirely.
 * Omitting `attributes` here previously behaved as if none of these
 * existed at all, which is exactly as broken as the hand-picked list this
 * replaced (both silently failed to parse a real textColor value off of
 * already-saved content). They have to be listed explicitly.
